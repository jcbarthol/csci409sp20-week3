<h1>About- Justin Bartholomew</h1>

<p>I grew up in Asheboro, NC for the first 13 years of my life. After I finished Middle School my family moved to
Charleston, SC to be closer to the ocean. I lived there for a couple years and made some really great friend that
im still in contact with now. We then moved to Myrtle Beach because my grandparents have lived here for the last 25
years and we wanted to be close by to take care of them as they got older. I went to Carolina Forest High School
for the last couple years of High School. After that I got my Associates degree from HGTC for computer programming
and decided to further my education at CCU because it was close by. I spend most of my time now when im not doing
schoolwork playing video games and skateboarding. Im hoping I will be able to complete my Bachelors at CCU in the Summer
of 2022 and then join the work force.</p>
